#### Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include the access token obtained from the login endpoint in the x-access-token header of the request.

#### Error Handling
The API returns appropriate error responses in case of invalid requests or authentication failures.

- 400 Bad Request: If the request body is missing or invalid.
- 401 Unauthorized: If the access token is missing or invalid.

#### Database
The API uses an SQLite database (songs.db) to store user information and song recommendations. The database schema consists of two tables:

- User: Stores user details such as username and password.
- Recommendation: Stores recommended songs for each user.
#### Song Recommendation
The API uses the recommend_songs function from the model module to generate song recommendations based on the provided song details. The recommendations are stored in the database and returned as a JSON response.

#### CORS Support
The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different domains. The CORS headers are configured using the Flask-CORS extension.

#### Deployment
The API can be deployed using any web server that supports Python and Flask. Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables and configurations for production deployment.
